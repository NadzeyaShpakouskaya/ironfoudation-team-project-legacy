## General info

The repo contains the source code of the `Woof` application.
The `Woof` application is an iOS app that provides the opportunity to connect dog owners and pet sitters to build trusted relationships between them.
You can use the app in 2 modes: like a pet owner or like a pet sitter.
As a pet owner, you can find a sitter for your pet(s) and manage a schedule of your pets' walks, which makes the process of caring for your lovely doggies easier.
As a pet sitter, you can provide the service of walks using your own schedule, prices, and other requirements, if needed.
